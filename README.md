 [![Build status](https://gitlab.inria.fr/ParMmg/ParMmg/badges/master/build.svg)](https://gitlab.inria.fr/ParMmg/ParMmg/commits/master) 

ParMmg is an open source software for parallel mesh adaptation of 3D volume meshes.
The algorithm of parallel mesh adaptation is inspired from the [Yales2](https://www.coria-cfd.fr/index.php/YALES2) algorithm (see [1](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fld.4204)).
ParMmg uses the [Mmg](http://mmgtools.org) software to perform the sequential remeshing steps.

## Get and compile the ParMmg project
### Needed tools
To get and build ParMmg, you will need:
 * **Git**: to download the code you will have to use a git manager. You can install a git manager from the link below but there are many other git clients that you can use:
    * [Official Git client](https://git-scm.com/download) (command line program)
    * [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
    * [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)  

    Note that if you uses Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows OS), you can simply activate the Git Module of the application.

  * **CMake** : ParMmg uses the CMake building system that can be downloaded on the
    following web page:
    [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/). On Windows OS,
    once CMake is installed, please <span style="color:red"> do not forget to
    mark the option: 
    ```
    "Add CMake to the system PATH for all users"
    ```
    </span>  

### ParMmg download and compilation
#### Unix-like OS (Linux, MacOS...)

  1. Get the repository:  
```Shell
      wget https://gitlab.inria.fr/ParMmg/ParMmg/-/archive/alpha/ParMmg-1.0.0.alpha.zip
```

or
     
```Shell
      git clone https://gitlab.inria.fr/ParMmg/ParMmg.git
```

  The project sources are available under the **_src/_** directory.

  2. By default ParMmg download and install automatically Mmg and Metis (as CMake external projects):
```Shell
      cd ParMmg  
      mkdir build  
      cd build  
      cmake ..  
      make  
      make install
```
  If the `make install` command fail, try to run the `sudo make install` command.
  If you don't have root access, please refers to the [Installation section](https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg/wiki/Setup-guide#iii-installation) of the [setup guide](https://github.com/MmgTools/Mmg/wiki/Setup-guide#setup-guide) of Mmg and follow the same steps.

  If you don't have internet access and/or want to use your own installation of
  Mmg (resp. Metis), you can disable the automatic download of Mmg setting the
  `DOWNLOAD_MMG` (resp. `DOWNLOAD_METIS`) CMake variable to `OFF`. In this case,
  you can help CMake to find Mmg (resp. Metis) by specifying the source
  directory of Mmg in the `MMG_DIR` variable and the build directory of Mmg in
  the `MMG_BUILDDIR` variable (resp. the installation directory of Metis in the
  `METIS_DIR` variable).
  
  Example:
  ```Shell
      cd ParMmg  
      mkdir build  
      cd build  
      cmake -DDOWNLOAD_MMG=OFF -DMMG_DIR=~/mmg -DMMG_BUILDDIR=~/mmg/build ..  
      cmake -DDOWNLOAD_METIS=OFF -DMETIS_DIR=~/metis-install ..  
      make  
      make install
```

  The **parmmg** application is available under the `parmmg_O3` command.

Note that if you use some specific options and want to set it easily, you can use a shell script to execute the previous commands. An example is provided in the Mmg wiki [here](https://github.com/MmgTools/mmg/wiki/Configure-script-for-CMake-(UNIX-like-OS)).

#### Windows OS
For now we do not provide the windows portability.

## Documentation
A short documentation is available [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/ParMmg/ParMmg/wikis/home#user-guide).
To get ParMmg help, run:
```Shell
  parmmg_O3 -h
```
To see the ParMmg default option:
```Shell
  parmmg_O3 -val
```

### Algorithm
The algorithm used in ParMmg has been developped by the Coria team and is detailed [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fld.4204).
